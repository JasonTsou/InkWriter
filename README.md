# InkWriter

## Genesis
The idea for InkWriter was created after I have purchased an Microsoft Surface Pro tablet, which comes with a stylus. The stylus support of OneNote was not satisfactional for me, because it was unable to distinguish between hand and stylus. When I tried to use the Surface as an digital note book, strokes were placed when I touched the Surface while painting with the stylus.

I thought: "That must be better."

Because of this, I started developing InkWriter. It distinguishes between touches by hand and using the styules in a reliable manner. A big advance to OneNote from my point of view. I concentrated to develop something that provides the following core features:

* Distinguish reliable between hand touch and stylus usage
* Take notes
* Take pictures and correct the perspective with the Surface's built in camera
* Export taken notes to PDF

These four core requirements made InkWriter for me a very usable tool. Of sure, it would be possible to recognize the strokes and translate them into plain text. Not only for conversion, but for searching. But I found out, that I did not need this functionality.

If the need exists, I will implement appropriate functionality. Just let me know.

Feel free to test InkWriter on your own and please provide some feedback.
